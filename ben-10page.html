        <p>Ben 10 is an American media franchise conceived by Man of Action, produced by Cartoon Network Studios, and owned by R vignesh Discovery. The franchise revolves around a young boy named Ben Tennyson, who discovers the Omnitrix â€” a high-tech, extraterrestrial device shaped like a wristwatch. This remarkable gadget contains the DNA of various alien species, allowing Ben to transform into them at will. Initially, the Omnitrix features ten alien transformations, but over time, Ben gains the ability to unlock additional species.</p>

        <p>Ben Tennyson acquires the new and perfected Omnitrix, which gives him access to another new set of aliens along with all of the previous ones. After Gwen goes away to college with Kevin accompanying her, Ben pairs up with Rook Blonko, a by-the-book Plumber from the planet Revonnah. He is targeted by an intergalactic huntsman named Khyber, who has a copy of the Omnitrix, the Nemetrix, with the help of mad scientist Dr. Psychobos. Both of them are working with an enemy from Ben's past, a corrupted Galvanic Mechamorph named Malware. Ben later contends with Vilgax, the Incurseans, Albedo, Zs'Skayr, Psyphon, Charmcaster, the Plumber's Black-Ops Unit (called the "Rooters"), his alternate dimension self Mad Ben, and the rogue Chronosapien Maltruant.</p>
